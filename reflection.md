I used Copilot to generate majority of the functions I created. It gernerated the unifrom_column_names, drop_missing_values, strip_whitespace, remove_currency_symbols, aand convert_data_types. I rpompted these mostly with a detailed comment that would explain what I wanted and why I wanted it so it could fully understand my intention behind the code. 
I had to rename multiple variables in order to understand its function and operations without having to look at the entire function. I also had to correct the order the functions were executed because the order suggested by Copilot would produce key errors, such as "quantity" not being defined because it was still "qty". I also had to create strip_column_whitespace because the original function only worked for the data inside of the keys and not the column names themselves. 
I learned that Copilot can be very useful at doing basic code, but the logic must be checked very carefully. Copilot is helpful for if you are lost and need a way to start code, but I think that is also a weakness because something may work for the particular data set, but any sort of variance or variability could cause the code to not work in a different data set. Furthermore, it does not work well unless the comments are detailed and explain not only what you want to do, but why you want to do it. Another weakness of copilot is it does not help generate code in the right order, as I had to add rename_columns because it was producing a Value Error.
